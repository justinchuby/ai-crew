# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.5.0] - Unreleased

### Added

#### Multi-CLI Provider Support

- **6 provider presets** — Built-in configurations for Copilot, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Cursor, Codex, and Claude. Each preset defines binary path, transport mode, ACP version, environment variables, and capability flags.
- **Cross-CLI model resolver** — 4-step resolution: tier alias → native passthrough → cross-provider equivalence mapping → fallback. Standard/fast/premium tier aliases work across all providers.
- **Claude SDK adapter** — Direct in-process adapter via `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` SDK with native session resume. Two-layer session ID (Flightdeck UUID immediate, SDK session ID async). Dynamic SDK loading with graceful fallback.
- **Unified adapter factory** — `createAdapterForProvider()` with `resolveBackend()` (fork/sdk/daemon) and `buildStartOptions()`. Single entry point for all agent spawning regardless of CLI provider.
- **Role file writers** — Per-provider role file generation for agent identity injection.

#### Agent Server Architecture (Two-Process Model)

- **Agent server entry point** — `AgentServer` class with message dispatch for spawn, terminate, prompt, cancel, list, subscribe, shutdown, configure. Orphan self-termination timer (12h default). PID file management.
- **ForkTransport** — Orchestrator-side transport using `child_process.fork()` IPC. Detached child survives orchestrator restarts. State machine: disconnected → connecting → connected → reconnecting.
- **ForkListener** — Agent server-side listener with dual IPC + TCP modes. IPC auto-created from `process.send`; TCP on localhost with port file for reconnection.
- **TCP reconnection auth** — 256-bit token, 5s timeout, `timingSafeEqual` validation. IPC connections skip auth. Token stored in `agent-server.token` file.
- **Health monitoring** — 3-state machine (connected → degraded → disconnected) with configurable ping intervals and thresholds. ForkListener auto-responds to pings.
- **AgentServerClient** — Client SDK with auto-reconnect, event subscription with `lastSeenEventId` cursor-based replay, and request timeout management.
- **Agent migration** — All agent spawning moved from orchestrator to agent server. `AgentManager` refactored to use IPC via `ServerClientBridge`.
- **State persistence** — Write-on-mutation with self-recovery. Orchestrator reconciliation on reconnect.

#### Knowledge System

- **KnowledgeStore with FTS5** — Full-text search backed by SQLite FTS5 with 4-tier memory categories (core, procedural, semantic, episodic).
- **Hybrid search with RRF fusion** — Reciprocal Rank Fusion combining FTS5 and semantic similarity for best-of-both retrieval.
- **Token-budgeted injection** — Knowledge injected into agent prompts within configurable token budgets, with prompt injection defense at the write boundary.
- **Training capture** — Records agent corrections and learning events for team knowledge accumulation.
- **Session knowledge extraction** — Automatic extraction of reusable knowledge from session transcripts.
- **Identity protection** — Shared memory with access controls preventing cross-agent identity leakage.

#### Portable Teams

- **Team export bundles** — Versioned `.flightdeck-team/` directory with manifest, per-agent configs, knowledge by category, and training history. SHA-256 integrity checksums. Selective export by agents or knowledge categories.
- **Team import with validation** — 5-phase validation (format, version, integrity, size, conflicts). Conflict strategies: agent (rename/skip/overwrite), knowledge (keep_both/prefer_import/prefer_existing/skip). Dry-run mode.
- **Team REST API** — POST export, POST import, GET list, GET team details. Rate-limited write endpoints.
- **Team management UI** — Consolidated Team page with roster, agent profiles, health dashboard, and lifecycle controls (retire/clone/retrain with confirmations).

#### Multi-Team / Multi-Project

- **`(projectId, teamId)` scoping** — Human-readable project IDs with collision-resistant generation. DB migration adds `team_id` to agent_roster, active_delegations, and dag_tasks with backward-compatible defaults.
- **Storage architecture** — `SyncEngine` for cross-device state synchronization, `StorageManager` for structured persistence.

#### UI

- **Projects panel** — Project management and selection interface.
- **Knowledge panel** — Browse, search, and manage knowledge entries across categories.
- **Agent Server panel** — Real-time status, agent list with expand/collapse, lifecycle controls (stop server, terminate agents) with confirmation dialogs. Renamed from DaemonPanel to AgentServerPanel.
- **Team Health page** — Status cards, mass failure alerts, polling-based live updates.
- **Agent Lifecycle modal** — Retire, clone, and retrain agents with confirmation workflows.

#### Research & Design Documents

- **Agent server architecture doc** — Two-process model design covering transport layer, reconnection, state persistence, and portable teams.
- **Multi-CLI ACP research** — Compatibility matrix for 6 CLI tools with ACP protocol analysis.
- **Claude agent-sdk comparison** — Evaluation of direct SDK integration vs. subprocess approach.

### Changed

- **Daemon removal** — Removed ~7,400 lines of unnecessary daemon code after agent server migration. Daemon concept replaced by two-process agent server architecture.
- **Frontend route rename** — `/daemon` → `/agent-server`, component `DaemonPanel` → `AgentServerPanel`, sidebar label updated.

### Fixed

- **Agent server fork crash** — `ForkTransport.fork()` defaulted `execArgv` to `[]`, stripping tsx's `--import` loader args. Child process couldn't load `.ts` files in dev mode. Fix: `filterExecArgv()` inherits parent's `process.execArgv` while stripping `--watch` flags. Also pipes child stderr for crash diagnostics.
- **Agent server routes not mounted** — `agentServerRoutes()` was never imported in `routes/index.ts`. Added import and mount.
- **Path traversal protection** — Shared `validatePathWithinDir()` utility handles null bytes, `../`, absolute paths, and directory boundary edge cases.
- **Prompt injection defense** — Write-boundary sanitization in `KnowledgeStore.put()` prevents stored injection attacks.
- **`resumeAll()` race condition** — Fixed concurrent resume causing duplicate agent instances.
- **HybridSearchEngine fetchLimit cap** — Prevents unbounded query expansion.
- **ModelResolver silent fallback** — Now warns when falling back to default tier model instead of silently substituting.
- **`projectId` collision** — Increased randomness from 2→3 bytes to reduce collision probability.

### Stats

- 55 implementation tasks completed across 2 waves
- 4,138+ tests passing
- ~25,000+ lines of production code added

## [0.4.0] - Unreleased

### Added

#### Architecture (8 recommendations from cross-project synthesis)

- **R1: DI Container** — `createContainer()` factory builds ~35 services in 6 dependency tiers with lifecycle shutdown. `index.ts` reduced from 411→146 lines. `apiRouter()` takes single `AppContext` object instead of 35 positional params.
- **R2: Shared Types Package** (`@flightdeck/shared`) — 11 Zod domain schemas, 46 server→client + 8 client→server WS event types as discriminated unions. Fixed 3 type drift bugs (Delegation missing `cancelled`/`terminated` statuses, DagTask missing `projectId`, ChatGroup missing `archived`). CI grep-based drift prevention.
- **R3: Coordination Reorg** — 46 files reorganized into 16 domain subdirectories with barrel exports. Root barrel re-exports everything for backward compat.
- **R4: Governance Hooks** — `GovernancePipeline` with 6 built-in hooks (file write guard, shell command blocklist, commit validation, rate limiting). Pre/post hook pipeline intercepts agent actions programmatically.
- **R5: Structured Logging** (Phases 1-2) — Replaced custom logger with pino. JSON output in production, pretty-printed in dev. AsyncLocalStorage context injection at 5 entry points — 85% of logs auto-get `agentId`/`projectId`/`role`.
- **R9: ACP Adapter** — `@agentclientprotocol/sdk` now imported in exactly 1 file (`adapters/AcpAdapter.ts`). `AgentAdapter` interface enables `MockAdapter` for testing.
- **R12: Secret Redaction** — Boundary redaction at WS broadcast, DB writes, logs, and `Agent.toJSON()`. 12 regex pattern categories (AWS, GitHub, OpenAI, Anthropic, JWT, PEM, Bearer, connection strings).
- **R15: Hot-Reload Config** — Configuration changes take effect without server restart, preserving active agent state. File watcher with mtime+size+hash change detection.

#### Performance

- **SQLite tuning** — Cache size 64→256MB, WAL monitoring with auto-checkpoint (PASSIVE mode)
- **Activity log auto-pruning** — 7-day retention + 50k row cap prevents unbounded growth
- **FileLockRegistry transaction safety** — Lock operations wrapped in transactions

#### Research & Documentation

- **Cross-project synthesis** — Analyzed 4 external repos (Symphony, Paperclip, Squad, Edict) producing 19 prioritized recommendations, 9 anti-patterns, and 6 cross-cutting themes
- **Agent Host Daemon design doc** — 1,466 lines covering architecture, security (14 threat mitigations), cross-platform support (Windows/Mac/Linux), UX design, quality bars
- **Multi-CLI ACP research** — Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Cursor CLI, Codex, Claude agent-sdk all compatible via existing AgentAdapter
- **Claude agent-sdk comparison report**
- **8 implementation specs** — Detailed specs for R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R9, R12, R15 with migration strategies, CI verification, and integration notes

### Changed

- **R5 Phase 3-4** (in progress) — Structured logging call-site migration: 193 calls across 50 files converting to pino structured API
- **Docs reorganization** — All documentation moved to `docs/` directory (`research/`, `specs/`, `reference/`)
- **Project rename** — `ai-crew` → `flightdeck` throughout all documentation
- **Synthesis report v3** — 8/19 recommendations marked as implemented with status tracking

### Fixed

- **SQLite WAL checkpoint** — Changed from TRUNCATE to PASSIVE mode (prevents blocking concurrent reads)
- **FileLockRegistry** — `lock:acquired` event no longer fires on TTL refresh (was causing spurious UI updates)

## [0.3.2] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed

- **DAG duplicate detection** — Raised similarity thresholds (0.6→0.8, 0.7→0.85), added role filter to prevent false positives when agents share domain vocabulary. Borderline matches (0.8–0.95) now create tasks with a warning instead of silently linking.
- **DAG "already done" UX** — `COMPLETE_TASK` on an already-completed task now returns a friendly message instead of an error.
- **DAG dependency inference** — Review tasks now find ALL matching-role dependencies (not just the most recent). Added "review all" pattern and plural role name normalization.
- **DAG coverage metric** — `TASK_STATUS` now shows what percentage of active agents have corresponding DAG tasks, with warnings for untracked agents.
- **DAG idle agent info** — "Newly ready" notifications now include available idle agents with matching roles.
- **dagTaskId warning** — `DELEGATE`/`CREATE_AGENT` without explicit `dagTaskId` now warns when auto-linker has to guess.
- **Live indicator contrast** — Timeline Live button now readable in light mode with proper Tailwind dark: variants.
- **Database purge** — Fixed 7 missing tables in cleanup, sub-agent conversation orphaning, and "All data" date filter bypass.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- **DAG edge highlighting** — hovering or clicking a task card highlights connected edges and dims unconnected ones; click to pin, Escape to unpin
- **Dynamic port allocation** — server auto-retries on EADDRINUSE (up to 10 ports), prints `FLIGHTDECK_PORT=NNNN` to stdout for discovery
- **Sequential dev launcher** (`scripts/dev.mjs`) — `npm run dev` starts Express first, captures the actual port, then starts Vite with the correct proxy target; multiple instances can run simultaneously
- **Commit sign-off convention** — all agent commits now include agent ID, role, and model name
- **Historical data on all pages** — Overview, Timeline, Canvas, Mission Control, Agents, Dashboard, and Tasks now load data from REST API when no live WebSocket agents are present. No more empty states for existing projects.
- **Unified project tabs** — Shared `<ProjectTabs>` component replaces inconsistent dropdowns/tabs. Used on Overview, Timeline, Canvas, and Mission Control with live-agent indicator dots.
- **Cumulative Flow diagram** — Replaced Task Burndown chart with stacked area chart showing created/in-progress/completed task counts over time.
- **Session Replay improvements** — Sticky scrubber bar (always visible at bottom), 4× default speed (was 1×), auto-switch to replay mode for historical sessions.
- **Timeline zoom & scroll** — Decoupled vertical/horizontal scroll axes. Ctrl+wheel zooms time axis, Shift+wheel pans horizontally. Arrow keys navigate lanes. +/−/Fit zoom buttons.
- **Timeline horizontal overflow** — Swim lanes scale with agent count (min 80px per lane). Horizontal scrollbar appears when agents exceed viewport width.
- **Chat virtualization** — `react-virtuoso` virtual scrolling for large message histories. Pinned user message banner. Grouped sequential messages from same sender.
- **PulseStrip polish** — Empty health indicators hidden. Badges link to /agents page. Client-side React Router navigation (no page reload).
- **Milestone filtering** — Milestones panel shows only progress reports, task completions, decisions, commits, and errors. Filtered out agent spawn/termination/delegation noise.
- **PROGRESS event pipeline** — Lead's PROGRESS reports now logged to activity ledger as `progress_update`, mapped to keyframes, and displayed in Milestones panel with 📊 icon.
- **Token estimation fallback** — Token tab estimates usage from `outputPreview` text (~4 chars/token) when agents don't report actual token counts. Shown with `~` prefix and `(est.)` suffix.
- **Milestone text wrapping** — Multi-line milestone labels with `line-clamp-2` and full-text tooltip. Removed backend 80-char truncation.
- **Data retention settings** — Data Management section in Settings with storage stats and cleanup by age (7d/30d/90d/all).
- **Group chat history** — Group chats persist per project and load from REST API for historical sessions.
- **Skill reference files** — 5 `.copilot/skills/` files documenting dev patterns, common bugs, user preferences, infrastructure, and testing patterns.
- **Comprehensive Timeline tests** — 45 tests covering scroll axis separation, zoom controls, drag-to-pan, horizontal overflow, keyboard navigation, lane layout, and replay controls.
- **Decision dismiss/ignore** — Dismiss clears decisions without notifying the lead agent. Works in individual decision UI, batch approval sidebar, keyboard shortcut ('d'), and mobile swipe-up gesture.

### Changed

- **Token display** — Removed monetary cost estimates. Token counts shown as estimates with `~` prefix and `(est.)` suffix.
- **Default replay speed** — Changed from 1× to 4× for faster session review.
- **Milestone curation** — Filtered from all system events to meaningful progress markers only.
- **Sidebar nav cleanup** — Removed agent count badge from Team sidebar tab (distracting)
- Vite proxy target is now configurable via `SERVER_PORT` env var instead of hardcoded `:3001`

### Fixed

- **Timeline scrub display for untitled projects** — SessionReplay team-resolution fallback now correctly resolves agents when project has no title
- **ProjectTabs/OverviewPage project identity** — Tab IDs and replay fetches now use project UUID instead of agent UUID, fixing timeline data mismatch for untitled projects
- **Project creation always assigns valid ID** — All spawn paths (lead/start, POST /agents, resume) now guarantee a project UUID; AgentManager has 4-layer fallback
- **Auto-DAG stuck pending tasks** — DAG engine now checks dependency satisfaction at task creation time, not only reactively; fixes tasks with pre-completed deps getting stuck
- **Ghost 'not in DAG' warning** — Fixed false warning firing on every completed task (#104)
- **Message segmentation** — Replaced heuristic-based bubble breaks with deterministic `agent:response_start` server signal for reliable message grouping
- **COMMIT command silent file exclusion** — Now warns about untracked files in related packages when new files aren't locked
- **Spawn mock arg count in CI** — Updated api.integration.test.ts for 9-arg spawn signature after project creation fix
- **Stale MobileApprovalStack test** — Updated Skip → Dismiss assertion after dismiss feature rename
- **Gantt chart vertical alignment** — fixed SVG viewBox stretching, time axis overlap with first task row, and container height formula for small task counts
- **Array sanitization in Community Playbooks** — secrets inside arrays now detected and stripped
- **PredictionService expired accuracy** — expired predictions marked instead of removed, counted correctly in accuracy stats

### Removed

- **Session score stars** — Removed subjective star ratings from Analytics session table.
- **Model Effectiveness chart** — Removed from Analytics (can't fairly compare models across varying task sizes).
- **Role Contribution chart** — Removed from Analytics (not a meaningful metric).
- **Predictions feature** — Removed from frontend (agent stall/cost/context handled automatically by the system).
- **Cost estimates** — Removed dollar amounts from token display; token counts only.
- Tool call activity cards from agent chat panel (redundant with inline activity messages)
- `.flightdeck/port` file mechanism replaced with stdout-based port discovery
